# Squirrel
Squirl is a new productivity tool for your browser.

How much of your day do you spend foraging through the many tabs of your browser window as you switch between different tasks? 
If you're anything like me, then the answer is too much.

Squirrel, for Chrome, allows you to switch between different browser windows with ease, promoting a window-per-workflow approach. 

Finished with a particular work-flow for now? You can save a browser session and restore it at some later time, like a squirrel burying a nut, to be dug up, brushed off and eaten when it's needed.

Squirrel is your new favourite companion.
